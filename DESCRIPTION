Title: Making %in% close enough
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Michael Culshaw-Maurer
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: By default, R's %in% functions similar to identical(), meaning it requires exact matches, compared to all.equal(), which allows for equality within machine tolerance.
    This package overrides %in% to make it similar to all.equal(), using machine tolerance by default, and rewrites R's default %in% to a new function called %idin%, which stands for "identical in".
